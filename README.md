## Overview of Project
Stock Analysis of green stock options using VBA macros

### Purpose
Steve is looking to analyze and prepare several data sets for some green energy companies. His parents are passionate about green energy, and they have decided to invest all their money into DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. Steve thinks that his parents' funds should be more diversified, so he would like an analyzed report of several green energy stocks, in addition to the DAQO stock.

## Analysis and Challenges 
Sevreal VBA macros were written, to help analysis the data in a quick and efficiant way. The AllStockAnalysis macro was written to analyis different green energy stock preformance. The macro runs sevreal functions, create headers for a analysis table, sort trading data by ID, volume traded, and yearly return. The analysis was of two years 2017 and 2018.

### Analysis of DAQO Stock Preformance 
The preformance of of the DA stock in 2017 held a 199.45% ROI with a volume of 35,796,200 trades. However in 2018 the DA stocks preformance held a -62.60% ROI with 107,873,900 total trades. With a 2 year average return of 136.85% ROI the DQ stock is seen as a high value, high risk, as a potential investment option. With a growing volume number it could be seen as a good time to buy to place a buy order as markets overall trend is downwards indicating that it is the green engery market in genreal that is dipping and not a specfic company loss of value.
